# README.md

## Project Overview

This Docker image is designed to provide a lightweight environment for Java applications that require web browsing capabilities and multimedia processing. It is built on top of the OpenJDK 17 base image and includes Google Chrome and FFmpeg for handling web automation and media processing tasks, respectively.

## Dockerfile Breakdown

1. **Base Image**: 
   - The image is based on `openjdk:17-jdk-slim`, which provides a slim version of the OpenJDK 17 Java Development Kit.

2. **Package Installation**:
   - The image installs essential packages using `apt-get`. It includes:
     - `wget`: For downloading files from the web.
     - `gnupg` and `ca-certificates`: For managing secure connections and verifying package signatures.
     - `google-chrome-stable`: The stable version of the Google Chrome browser, which is useful for web scraping or automated testing.
     - `ffmpeg`: A powerful multimedia framework for handling video, audio, and other multimedia files and streams.

3. **Working Directory**:
   - The working directory is set to `/app`, where you can place your Java applications or scripts.

4. **Default Command**:
   - The default command is set to `bash`, allowing users to interact with the container's shell.

## Usage

To build and run this Docker image, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-java-chrome-ffmpeg-app .
   ```

2. **Run the Container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm my-java-chrome-ffmpeg-app
   ```

Once inside the container, you can execute your Java applications, use Google Chrome for web automation or testing, and utilize FFmpeg for any multimedia processing tasks.

## Suitable Use Cases

This Docker image is ideal for various scenarios, including but not limited to:

- **Web Automation**: Use Selenium or other web scraping frameworks with Google Chrome to automate browser tasks.
- **Media Processing**: Utilize FFmpeg for converting, streaming, or processing audio and video files within your Java applications.
- **Testing and Development**: Create a consistent development environment for Java applications that require browser interactions or media manipulation.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Integrate this image into CI/CD pipelines where Java applications need to be tested with browser-based interactions.
